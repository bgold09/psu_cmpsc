Say something about the project.

The function of this project is to perform functionality similar to
the first phase of the C compiler. The project actually consists of
four different programs:

1) pass1 -- whitespace and end-of-line markers
    # whitespace characters form feed, vertical tab and horizontal tab 
        are each replaced with a single space character
    # the two-character sequence return-newline is replaced by a single newline character
    # the return character is replaced by a single newline character
2) pass2 -- trigraph replacement
    # trigraph characters are replaced with their ASCII equivalent
    # reference: <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digraphs_and_trigraphs>
3) pass3 -- source line continuation
    # a line ending with backslash is joined with the following line
    # There are two potential warning messages:
        "warning: backslash at end of file"
        "warning: backslash-newline at end of file"
4) pass4 -- comment removal
   # single-line comments (start with //) are replace with a single space and newline
   # multi-line comments (/*  */) are replaced with a single space if they are one line,
       or newline characters for every line long it is
   # character constants and string literals are printed as-is
