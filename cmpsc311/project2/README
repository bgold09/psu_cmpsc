note: This program uses the header <stdbool.h>, so it must be compiled
      using c99 or later

The function of this program is to take a file into the stdin and 
print information about the characters in that file. Such information 
includes what types of characters are present (alphanumerics, controls,
blanks, hexadecimal digits). It also counts the occurrences of different 
escape sequences ('\r' and '\n' in this case) to determine the file type. 

The program also accounts for several oddities in the program, as well
as for a few possible errors. It would have been better if I had some
way to check for those errors to make sure that the error handling
was properly implemented on my part.
