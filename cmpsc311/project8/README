The program works. pr8 mimics the behavior of the make program with the '-n' option enabled. 

Total Time spent on the project: approximately 10 hrs. 
The project was mostly straightforward and easy to complete. 

Known Bugs:
  # There is a discovered issue with the way the program deals with macro expansion. 
    We feel this is a bug in the code provided to us, and as such, did not attempt to fix it 
	(as it was outside the scope of this project, having been told that we are to build this program 
	under the assumption that the macro expansion was successful).
	
  # There was a discovered issue with the code provided to us, related to trying to read empty files as makefiles. Attempting to run an empty makefile would cause a Segmentation Fault. This bug, although present in the code provided, was fixed in pr8. pr8 provides an error message and quits gracefully. 

From here it would be trivial to create a rudimentary make program. Now that we can determine when 
it is appropriate to execute a recipe, all we would need to do is provide a call to an exec function 
with the recipe we are given.
