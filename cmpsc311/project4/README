This project represents a program "hake" that mimics part of the functionality of the UNIX system tool "make."

'hake' accepts three option, '-h', '-v' and '-f'
  # '-h' prints usage information for hake
  # '-v' turns on certain messages that tell the user about various program functionality
    ## the user can supply up to three '-v' options to turn on more messages
  # 'f' accepts a single argument that specifies a hakefile
    ## multiple '-f' option can be supplied
    ## supplying "-" as the argument is interpreted as "read from stdin"

When at least one verbose mode flag is supplied, hake will print out each line of the makefiles being read
  and an analysis of each.
A line can be diagnosed as a comment, macro, target-prerequisite line, recipe, include or empty line.
When an include statement is reached, hake will try to analyize the contents of the file
  if it can open it or the file has not already been read.

I thought that the ability to read from stdin was actually a pretty interesting piece of functionality.
  This could be useful if the user wanted to quickly make a Makefile on-the-fly if it is something
  that they would use only once.
